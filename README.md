# ForceCalc

## Description

This app allows to calculate unknown reactions of supports and moment vector of the beam that loaded from the left by spring and has a smooth support at the right.

Software could be used by automotive designers that produce car's switches especially on the design stage. Switches like power window switches

or parking brake switch

ets.

This scheme reflects a simplified model of regular switches used inside cars.

It is a mechanical scheme that consists of:

 - two journal bearings (A & B) with free movement along X axis;
 - smooth support C at the right end of the beam;
 - beam placed between supports A & C; 
 - spring that generate external linear load on the beam's left side.

Contact field describes friction between beam and support C. First column is a friction coefficient (as an assumption we use [dry friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction) laws). "X coordinate" and “Y coordinate” columns define position (mm) of support C compared to coordinate origin marked as purple circle.

Plunger field describes interaction between beam and supports A & B. First column is a friction coefficient (dry friction laws assumption is also applied here). “Distance A” indicates distance between B & C (mm), while “Distance B” - distance between A & B (mm).

Spring field describes linear spring characteristics (based on [Hooke's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law)). “Stiffness” column contains spring [stiffness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness) in (N/mm), “Free length” - the length of the spring when uncompressed, “Length” - the length of the compressed spring.

Angles field consists of the following:  “Direction of normal reaction force” is an orientation of smooth support, “Direction of plunger friction forces” and “Direction of normal reaction friction force” are directions where friction forces were applied. The relative motion of the beam occurs in the directions opposite to friction forces.

The usage of this software allows us to:
 1. Calculate normal reaction at the end of the beam (smooth support C) to avoid accumulating contact stress so that we could analyze robustness and reliability of a switch.
 2. Find a flexible solution based on versatility of tactile feelings that would satisfy the customer needs. 

To solve the issues mentioned above our beam is constantly being pushed by spring from the left end, reflecting the force to smooth support at the right end. This force creates haptic torque that could be felt while pushing or pulling the switch. Reactions applied from each support are depicted as arrows, with direction of force shown by arrowheads.

At the same time the beam doesn't move anywhere while we change it's position by hand being in a static balance that allows us to find unknown variables (forces):
 - _Ra_ - reaction on support A;
 - _Rb_ - reaction on support B;
 - _NR_ - normal reaction on support C.

where _α0_ - direction of _Ra_, _α1_ - direction of _Rb_, _α2_ - direction of _NR_, _β0_ - direction of friction force in A support, _β1_ - direction of friction force in B support, _β2_ - direction of friction force in C support, _f_ - friction coefficient in A & B support, _μ_ - friction coefficient in C support, _a_ - length between A & B, _b_ - length between B & C, _LOAD_ - external load generated from a spring.

## Project Structure

### .github

In `.github` folder you can find workflow [force.yml](.github/workflows/force.yml) that has an instructions for testing project after pushing the code to main branch. It runs [test.py](force/tests.py) test where we check calculated variable _Ra_, _Rb_ and _NR_ by putting it to equations \(1). For project we should additionally install _numpy_ package for python:
```
pip install numpy
```

### SECRET_KEY

In `SECRET_KEY` folder we have generated by django a key. And each time when we run server in cmd by `python manage.py runserver` we should open and read the key:
```
with open('SECRET_KEY/ForceCalc.txt') as f:
    SECRET_KEY = f.read().strip()
```

### ForceApp

In `ForceApp` you can find [settings.py](ForceApp/settings.py) where LOGIN_URL, STATIC_URL is specified. Variable LOGIN_URL we use in pair with [@login_required](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required) decorator. You can find its usage in [views.py](force/views.py). STATIC_URL is pointing on place where [static](force/static) files are located.

### force

 - [`static`](force/static)
 - [`templates`](force/templates)
 - [admin.py](force/admin.py)
 - [models.py](force/models.py)
 - [tests.py](force/tests.py)
 - [urls.py](force/urls.py)
 - [views.py](force/views.py)

#### models

In project models we define **User**, **Mail** (user creates subject, writes a body of a mail and send it to recipients), **Flag** (keeps track of what is a status of a mail or it was read or archived), **Project** (fields like project_number, project_name, assembly_number that describe a project are assigned here), **Contact** (defines a set of contact parameters inside a choosen project), **Plunger** (defines a set of plunger parameters), **Spring** (defines a set of spring parameters), **Angles** (defines a set of angles parameters).

Also we define a set of validators that will attache to corresponding models, _validate_project_number_, _validate_assembly_number_, _validate_fractional_, _validate_positive_, _plungerFric_validation_, _validate_contact_angle_.

There are two main classes in addition:
 - _calc_forces_;
 - _calc_torque_.

**calc_forces.solver()** method does directly a calculation of reactions in system of equations (1) by using _np.array()_ and _np.linalg.solve()_ methods. 

**calc_forces.corrected_forces()** method corrects a direction for reactions in A and B supports.

**calc_torque** class is used for calculating a resulting torque in C support. A magnitude and a sign of the value is important. Torque depending of the lever of switch actuating gives us a tactile feedback.

**calc_torque.solver()** - is a method that allows to find third component of torque vector. calc_torque.intersection() method of finding the minimal distances from origin to force vectors in support C.

#### admin

In the [admin.py](force/admin.py) we register our models and specify a view for User and Mail, for "user_permissions" and "recipients" fields we define a filter_horizontal attribute.

#### tests

In [tests.py](force/tests.py) we create a test user, project and parameters (contact, plunger, spring, angles). Then passing parameters through calc_forces.solver() we find unknowns _Ra_, _Rb_, _NR_ that will go directly to equations. Therefore we check correctness of calculation.

#### [urls](force/urls.py) 

Project has 10 pages:
 1. '' - start page.
 2. 'login' - login page.
 3. 'logout' - logout page.
 4. 'register' - register page.
 5. 'mail/inbox' - page with inbox mail.

   1. 'parameter/<str:name>/<int:project_num>' - get, save, change or delete parameter.
   2. 'result' - getting a calculated results.

#### templates

[templates](force/templates) include html pages.

#### views

Here is all logic of the site, in particular html rendering, django forms setting and so on.

One of the functions is _parse_from_js()_ that takes request.body as arguments and convert it to regular python dictionary. Used in three cases:
 - creating new project;
 - creating new parameter (contact | plunger | spring | angles);
 - change parameter.

_ProjectForm_, _ContactForm_, _PlungerForm_, _SpringForm_, _AnglesForm_, _PasswordChangeForm2_ - are a forms inherited from model forms in some forms we define custom id and class for bootstrap.

Render views are:
1. index. Render starting page.
2. login_view. Render logine page.
3. register. Render registration page.
4. password_change. Render page for changing a password.
5. mail. Render a mail page.
6. calculation. Render calculation page.

#### static/force

 - [waves.js](force/static/force/waves.js)

In waves.js file we define a functions that allow us control wave effect when buttons were pushed. Google pages also have this effect. 

Button consists of two elements one is a visible button and second is a circle but we see this circle only while running an animation [wave](force/static/force/styles.css#L167-L177), [user-menu-wave](force/static/force/styles.css#L209-L219), [sidebar-wave](force/static/force/styles.css#L747-L757). The animation is aimed to continuosly increasing circle diameter starting from 0.

By [getCoords](force/static/force/waves.js#L1-L10) function we find a current coordinates of button and using [waves](force/static/force/waves.js#L12-L35) function run a animation for second element that has diameter 0. Center of this radial distribution is where user click inside buttons boundary. But this won't work without last [dummy operations](force/static/force/waves.js#L26-L35) like refreshing css animation. Without this operations the animation will be playing only once and will stop until we reload a page.

[is_clicked](force/static/force/waves.js#L37-L52) function is used for correct detection of the element where animation should play.

 - [calculation_get.js](force/static/force/calculation_get.js)

This file is used specifically for retrieving data dinamically without reloading a page.

function [parameter](force/static/force/calculation_get.js#L1-L20) allows to fetch parameters data and [get_forces](force/static/force/calculation_get.js#L22-L50) is used for retrieving from the server a calculated unknowns Ra, Rb, NR.

 - [calculation_delete.js](force/static/force/calculation_delete.js)

All the time when we delete the parameter by func [delete_data](force/static/force/calculation_delete.js) we need to create csrf token for protecting our server. For this issue we have hidden html input generated by Django with name attribute is equal to csrfmiddlewaretoken. And we pass this token to the server:
```
const csrftoken = document.querySelector('[name=csrfmiddlewaretoken]').value;
const request = new Request(
    `/some_url/`,
    {headers: {'X-CSRFToken': csrftoken}}
);
fetch(request, {
    method: 'DELETE',
    mode: 'same-origin',
})

```

 - [calculation_post.js](force/static/force/calculation_post.js)

We get our data from the parameters field and if all is ok, we recieve a good response end after 3 second all green marks will disappear [lines from 158 - 182](force/static/force/calculation_post.js#L158-L182), but if our models validation isn't passed we recieve as response error message. 

[calculation_put.js](force/static/force/calculation_post.js) has the same structure as calculation_post.js.

 - [header.js](force/static/force/header.js)

In header.js we control header's buttons and pop up user menu, also we connect animation to buttons and use 0.3 sec time for changing a page.

 - [paginatorsearch.js](force/static/force/paginatorsearch.js)

File describes paginator bar. And reactJS instance [searchComponentInstance](force/static/force/paginatorsearch.js#L166) was used here. Each time when search query was typed or another page was choosen we call [retrieve_items](force/static/force/filter.js#L1-L127) function from [filter.js](force/static/force/filter.js) and load appropriate numbers of items and with matching in context with query. 

 - [filter.js](force/static/force/filter.js)

General function is [items_retrieve](force/static/force/filter.js#L1-L127) that creates a list of the projects or emails based on page, query etc. Also we use popstates for project page, mail/inbox, mail/sent and mail/compose [filter line 149](force/static/force/filter.js#L149). Inside items_retrieve function we create a [table](force/static/force/filter.js#L27-L34) with a names of columns depending on what kind of lists we want to recieve, projects or emails. 

In filter.js we also fetch a post request that is aimed to save new project as a response we will get good marks or error messages styling is from bootstrap validators for that we should mark field as 'is-valid' or 'is-invalid' [206-214](force/static/force/filter.js#L206-L214). At the end of the function we call [expand](force/templates/force/layout.html#L30-L70) function that is dinamically pop up our fields. During expand action we use a couple of css animations like [arrow-rotate-downwards](force/static/force/styles.css#L405-L412) and [arrow-rotate-upwards](force/static/force/styles.css#L413-L420) that rotates arrow on the new project button, and [expand](force/static/force/styles.css#L422-L435) / [closed](force/static/force/styles.css#L436-L449) animations that expand or close project's or parameter's fields changing their height from 0 to 100% and vice versa.

 - [mail.js](force/static/force/mail.js)

mail.js controls all mail functions in the project, such as: render an email's content by [render_email](force/static/force/mail.js#L247-L331) function that is also describes a bihavior with archiving and replaying events; showing a list depending on topic (inbox, compose, archived or sent) [44-127](force/static/force/mail.js#L44-L127); showing up or shutting down elements [142-160](force/static/force/mail.js#L142-L160); control size of textarea [137-140](force/static/force/mail.js#L137-L140);

 - [calculation_react.js](force/static/force/calculation_react.js)

Probably the biggest one.

This is a main file for controlling parameter fields and calculating each time when any field was changed.

In addition for styles.css we define a [styles](force/static/force/calculation_react.js#L48-L72) in render function. 

In constructer we define an [initial values](force/static/force/calculation_react.js#L5-L44) for mechanical scheme.

First function is a functions where we hide or show buttons such as delete, save or edit also we have three state for fields:
1. newState. All filds has initial values, parameter name is empty and option is 'new parameter'. Delete, Edit buttons are hidden;
2. activeState. Parameter name is read only, options is a seleted current parameter and values are retrieved from server's database. Save, Edit buttons are hidden;
3. editState. Triggered as we start to change some field's value. Only Save button is hidden.

Next function is a [componentDidMount()](force/static/force/calculation_react.js#L393-L430) calls just after mounting all html's elements. Here we hide all delete, edit buttons, call unread_emails() that allow us to see if there any unread emails we have. Finally we create an options for select element [399-423](force/static/force/calculation_react.js#L399-L423), [calculate a forces](force/static/force/calculation_react.js#L436-L539) based on initial values and assign expand function for parameter fields.

[forces()](force/static/force/calculation_react.js#L436-L539) takes all values from react states passes it to [get_forces()](force/static/force/calculation_get.js#L22-L50) and recieve a response of calculated forces after that passes this answer to [draw](force/static/force/calculation_canvas.js#L315-1058) function that visualizes that forces on canvas. 

All other functions is aimed to do regular work like retrieving parameter's data after choosing an option, clearing validator's tooltips, updating inputs on fields, elaboration of all button's click events.

At the end of the calculation_react.js we define a 2d canvas [1148-1149](force/static/force/calculation_react.js#L1148-L1149), make initial scales for canvas and draw initial drawing [1152-1167](force/static/force/calculation_react.js#L1152-L1167)

 - [calculations_canvas.js](force/static/force/calculation_canvas.js)

Is figuring out a canvas with mechanical scheme and forces showing on that scheme.

When mouse is over the canvas scroll function should be disabled [1-7](force/static/force/calculation_canvas.js#L1-L7), because scroll defines a scaling on the canvas.

First function draws scheme based on initial calculation_react states and defines a responsivness of canvas while resizing.

After that we define a scrolling event [65-99](force/static/force/calculation_canvas.js#L65-L99), 'zoom' on wheel scroll event.

Next is detecting the cursor while its over canvas [101-143](force/static/force/calculation_canvas.js#L101-L143) and translating a content of the canvas while mouse left button is pushing [148-167](force/static/force/calculation_canvas.js#L148-L167).

Next functions [multiply](force/static/force/calculation_canvas.js#L280-L299) and [rotate](force/static/force/calculation_canvas.js#L301-L313) represent mathematical [Matrix Multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication) and [Rotation_matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation Matrix) that allow us to rotate our force vectors.

[draw](force/static/force/calculation_canvas.js#L315-L1058) function draws all content on the canvas.

 - [style.css](force/static/force/styles.css)

In styles.css we describe layout on the site, dimensioning (box-sizing: border-box) and flex type of the elements [1-52](force/static/force/styles.css#L1-L52). Also we define a level of responsiveness:
 - first level - is up to 970px of screen width [454-506](force/static/force/styles.css#L454-L506);
 - second - is from 540px to 970px [508-555](force/static/force/styles.css#L508-L555);
 - third - is from 285px to 540px [557-561](force/static/force/styles.css#L557-L561).
