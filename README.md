# ForceCalc

This app allows to calculate unknown reactions of supports and resulting vector of moments of the beam that loaded from the left by spring and has a smooth support at the right.

Software could be used by automotive designers that produce car's switches especially on the design stage. Switches like power window switches

or parking brake switch
